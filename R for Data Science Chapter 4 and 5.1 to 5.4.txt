1. The code doesn't work because "my_variable" in the second line has a 1 instead of an i 
2. ggplot(data = mpg) +  
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y=hwy))

  filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)

3. This brings up the keyboard shortcut quick reference tab. Another way to get to the same place is to go to Tools -> Keyboard Shortcuts Help

1. 
    1. filter(flights, arr_delay>=120)
    2. filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))
    3. filter(flights, carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'DL')
    4. filter(flights, month >= 7 & month <= 9)
    5. filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
    6. filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, dep_delay-arr_delay > 30)
    7. filter(flights, dep_time <=600 | dep_time == 2400)
2. between() can function as a shortcut for x>= left & x<= right. Can be used to find values in a specific range. It could be used in (4) above for the months 7 and 9, as well as (7) above to pull hours between 12am and 6am
3. 8,255 have a missing dep time. dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, and air_time are also missing. These could just be data that didn't get recorded on the flights
4. NA ^ 0 is always going to be 1.
   NA | TRUE will always be true since | siginifies TRUE if either term is true
   & will return a value based on one of the values, so you don't need a value on both sides


5.3
1. df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, desc(is.na(x)))
arrange(df, -(is.na(x)))
2. arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
3.arrange(flights, (arr_time - dep_time))
4. arrange(flights, desc(distance)) %>% select(1:5, distance)
arrange(flights, distance) %>% select(1:5, distance)

5.4
1. select(flights, dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, c(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay))
flights %>% select(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights %>% select_("dep_time",  "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
2. You would get the variable once if you include the name of it multiple times
3. It returns all variables you ask for
4. Yes, somewhat, since the select clause is not case sensitive. You could add a "ignore.case = FALSE"
